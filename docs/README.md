# Documentation

This directory contains implementation plans and documentation for the Statistical Model Suggester optimization project.

## Database Optimization Plans

### [DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](./DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md)

Comprehensive implementation plan for optimizing the model database architecture:

- **Current Issues**: 204KB monolithic JSON, linear search, memory inefficiency
- **5-Phase Implementation**: Database refactoring → Service integration → Template optimization → API endpoints → Performance tuning
- **Timeline**: 7-week structured approach
- **Success Metrics**: 90% startup reduction, 80% memory savings, 100x search improvement

### [QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md)

Concise reference guide for developers:

- **Problem Summary**: Key inefficiencies identified
- **Solution Overview**: Service layer, progressive loading, indexed search
- **Implementation Priority**: Phases and quick wins
- **File Changes**: New files to create and existing files to modify

## Implementation Context

These plans address performance and scalability issues identified in:

- **Database Storage**: 204KB JSON file loaded entirely at startup
- **Template System**: Heavy synchronous loading without progressive enhancement
- **Search Performance**: O(n) linear scans instead of indexed lookups
- **Memory Usage**: All 396 models kept in memory regardless of usage

## Expected Improvements

- **90% reduction** in application startup time
- **80% reduction** in memory usage
- **100x improvement** in search performance
- **50% improvement** in perceived page load times

## Next Steps

1. Review implementation plans
2. Create feature branch for development
3. Begin with Phase 1: Database refactoring
4. Implement backwards compatibility layer
5. Add comprehensive testing and benchmarking
